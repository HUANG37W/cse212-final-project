# Stack
## Jason Huang - CSE 212

## Introduction
#### A stack is a data structure that stores item in a Last-In/First-Out. This is frequently referred to as LIFO.

## Use of Stacks

#### In general, stacks are useful for processing nested structures or for functions which call other functions (or themselves). A nested structure is one that can contain instances of itself embedded within itself. For example, algebraic expressions can be nested because a sub expression of an algebraic expression can be another algebraic expression. Stacks are used to implement functions, parsers, expression evaluation, and backtracking algorithms.

## Implementing Stacks

#### There are a couple of options when youâ€™re implementing a Python stack. The most common way is using a list.

### Using list to create a Python Stack

#### The built-in list structure that you likely use frequently in your programs can be used as a stack. Instead of .push(), you can use .append() to add new elements to the top of your stack, while .pop() removes the elements in the LIFO order:

## Stack in Python
| Common Stack Operation | Description| Python Code|Performance|
|---|----|----|----|
| push(value) | Adds "value" to the back of the stack. | **my_stack.append(value)** | O(1) - Performance of adding to the end of a dynamic array |
| pop() | Removes and returns the item from the back of the stack.| **value = my_stack.pop()** | O(1) - Performance of removing from the end of a dynamic array |
| size() | Return the size of the stack. | **length = len(my_stack)** | O(1) - Performance of returning the size of the dynamic array |
| empty() | Returns true if the length of the stack is zero. | **if len(my_stack) == 0:** | O(1) - Performance of checking the size of the dynamic array |

## Example

```python
myList = []

myList.append('a')
myList.append('b')
myList.append('c')
print(myList)
#[a,b,c]
myList.pop()
#It will remove the last item added, in this case 'c'
print(myList)
#[a,b]
myList.pop()
myList.pop()
myList.pop()
#It will raise an IndexError if you call .pop() on an empty stack.


```

## Problem to Solve

```python

class Stack():
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []

    def insert(self, item):
    #Insert an item to the list

    #Your code goes here

    def remove(self):
    #Remove an item from the list

    #Your code goes here

    def is_empty(self):
    #check if the list is empty
        return self.items == []

    def peek(self):
    #check what is the last item of the list if it is not empty

    #your code goes here

    def get_stack(self):
        return self.items

myStack = Stack()
myStack.insert("A")
myStack.insert("B")
myStack.insert("C")
myStack.insert("D")
print(myStack.peek())
# [D]
myStack.remove()
myStack.remove()
print(myStack.get_stack())
# [A,B]
myStack.insert("E")
print(myStack.get_stack())
# [A,B,E]


```
