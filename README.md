This is the CSE212 Programming with Data Structures

Course Outcomes

Problem Solver: Apply a systematic approach to writing code to solve problems involving data structures.  
Evaluator:  Evaluate the performance of alternative solutions for code containing data structures using big O notation.  
Reviewer: Predict the purpose and behavior of existing code containing data structures. 
Tester: Discover defects using testing in code containing data structures. 
Conversant: Articulate the answers to technical questions involving data structures.  
Self-Reliant: Solve problems using data structures independently. 
CSE 212 explores the world of data structures to help you organize information properly in your software.  You will study the dynamic array, stack, queue, set, map, linked list, and tree as well as big O notation and recursion.  While learning both the characteristics and applied uses of these structures, you will explore several fundamental techniques used by software programmers including: problem solving, analyzing software performance, reviewing code, finding defects using testing, and articulating answers to technical questions.
